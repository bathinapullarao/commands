multi-region or active-active architecture
Multi-Region (Active-Passive) Architecture
Rolling Deployment: Deploy the new version gradually, replacing old pods one by one while the app stays live.
                    How it works: Some pods run old version, Some pods run new version
                    Pros:No downtime,Simple to implement
                    Cons:Old & new versions run together,Rollback is slower
Blue-Green Deployment: Maintain two identical environments:
                       Blue = current live version
                       Green = new version
                      How it works: Deploy new version to Green, Test Green, Switch traffic from Blue → Green instantly
                       Pros:Instant rollback, Clean release
                       Cons: Higher cost (double resources), Traffic is shared automatically
Canary Release: Release new version to a small % of users first, then increase gradually.
                      How it works: 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%
                      Pros:Lowest risk, Real user validation
                      Cons: More complex traffic control
When to Use: Rolling: Small changes, stateless apps
             Blue-Green: Critical releases, banking apps
             Canary: ML models, large user bases
